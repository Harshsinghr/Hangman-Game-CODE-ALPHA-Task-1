## Introduction

In this simple yet fun game, players guess the letters of a randomly selected word from a predefined list. The game continues until the player either guesses the word or exhausts their allowed number of incorrect attempts.

## How to Play

1. The game randomly selects a word from a list of fruits.
2. You will be prompted to guess letters one at a time.
3. For each incorrect guess, the hangman progresses through six stages.
4. If you guess the word before reaching the sixth incorrect guess, you win!
